# Tyba-BE-Challenge
This project was developed using node.js and express.
In order to run and test this project, that aims to solve the Back End Challenge for Tybe, you should execute in the command line on the project folder:
1. npm install
2. node users.js

This will deploy the project on localhost, at port 3000. 

To test it, Postmant test were created, so its installation is required if the reader does not have it. 

You should import the collection of tests to Postman. These are located on the test folder. The tests are meant to be executed in the order that is previously stablished. 

It should be noted that there is no database connection for the project. In order to keep simplicity, all data is saved locally each time it is deployed, but connections could be stablished (to relational and non-relational databases) if needed.
